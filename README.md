# Unity Asesprite Importer

This is an importer for Aseprite files. The code is based on
code originally published in the Metasprite project. 

However this importer here is a heavily rewritten version.
It no longer requires separate asset files to hold import configuration 
data and stores all imported artefacts as sub-objects of the 
original Aseprite file. 

The import will automatically import animations.

## Installation

Copy the contents of this repository into a sub-directory in
"Assets/Plugins" in your unity project.
